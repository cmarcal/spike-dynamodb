# DynamoDB Study Project

This project serves as a learning exercise for working with DynamoDB, Amazon Web Services' (AWS) fully managed NoSQL database service. The project utilizes default functions and features provided by AWS SDKs to interact with DynamoDB programmatically.

## Overview

DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It is designed to handle large amounts of traffic and data with high availability and reliability.

### Project Goals

- **Learning AWS SDK:** Understand how to use AWS SDK (such as AWS SDK for JavaScript) to interact with DynamoDB.
- **Basic Operations:** Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on DynamoDB tables.
- **Data Modeling:** Explore different ways to model data in DynamoDB based on use cases.
- **Best Practices:** Adhere to AWS best practices for DynamoDB usage, including capacity management and partitioning strategies.

## Setup

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
   - Set up an AWS account and configure AWS credentials with appropriate IAM permissions.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cmarcal/spike-dynamodb.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure AWS SDK:**
   - Ensure your AWS credentials are configured either via `~/.aws/credentials` file or environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`).

## Usage

The project includes examples of basic DynamoDB operations using AWS SDK default functions. Each script (`createTable.js`, `addItem.js`, `getItem.js`, etc.) demonstrates a specific DynamoDB operation.

To run a script, use Node.js:

```bash
npm createTable.js
```

Replace `createTable.js` with the script you want to execute (`addItem.js`, `getItem.js`, etc.).
